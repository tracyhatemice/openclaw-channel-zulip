## Features

- ✅ **Concurrent message processing** — events fire-and-forget with staggered start times (200 ms apart), so a burst of incoming messages is handled in parallel rather than queued sequentially
- ✅ **Reaction indicators** — configurable emoji reactions signal processing state (`:working_on_it:` on start, ✅ on success, ❌ on error, with optional clear-on-finish)
- ✅ **File uploads** — inbound Zulip file attachments are downloaded and forwarded to the AI pipeline; outbound media is uploaded via Zulip's file upload API
- ✅ **Full actions API** — react, edit, delete, archive, move messages/topics; subscribe/unsubscribe streams; user management (requires `enableAdminActions: true`)
- ✅ **Topic directives** — reply topics can be scoped per-message, enabling organized thread-based conversations
- ✅ **Multi-account support** — run multiple Zulip bot accounts in one OpenClaw instance via the `accounts` map
- ✅ **DM & channel policies** — open / pairing / allowlist / disabled per account
- ✅ **Block streaming** — real-time streaming replies with configurable coalescing (min chars / idle timeout)
- ✅ **Onboarding wizard** — `openclaw onboard` walks you through setup interactively

## How to get a Zulip API key

1. Log in to your Zulip organization
2. Go to **Settings → Your bots** (or create a bot at **Settings → Bots → Add a new bot**)
3. Copy the bot's **email** and **API key**
4. Use `https://your-org.zulipchat.com` as the `url`

## Why concurrent processing?

Most channel plugin implementations process incoming messages one at a time — each message waits for the previous one to finish before starting. Under load (e.g. a burst of messages after reconnect) this creates noticeable latency for later messages.

This plugin processes events **concurrently**: each message is dispatched immediately (fire-and-forget with error handling) and a small 200 ms stagger is introduced between starts for natural pacing. The result is that ten simultaneous messages all start processing within ~2 seconds of each other instead of serially.

## Updating

If installed via npm:

```sh
openclaw plugins update zulip
```

If installed from local source:

```sh
cd openclaw-channel-zulip
git pull
openclaw gateway restart
```

---

## Plugin ID

The plugin id is `zulip` (defined in `openclaw.plugin.json`). Use this id in `plugins.allow` and with `openclaw plugins` commands.
